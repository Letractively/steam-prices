My personal recommendations

= Alternative shops =

There are lots of great alternative shops. My current personal favourite is gog.com. They sell DRM-free PC classics for low prices ($6 and $10) with no regional discrimination. They have a huge catalogue of good old games and publish at least two more every week.

Another exaple is indie publisher [http://www.playgreenhouse.com/ greenhouse]. They are the publishers of Penny Arcades episodic adventure game series "On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness". They publish several other indie titles as well, some in competition with Steam. They have their own achievements system called "Triumphs and standings" if you're into that sort of thing. They unfortunately use DRM but they aren't dicks about it, you can install as many times as you want "within reason". They use the same prices no matter where you live.

If you're generally into indie games you may want to look into some of these great titles, which I can personally recommend:
 * World of Goo - available on [http://store.steampowered.com/app/22000/ Steam], [http://www.playgreenhouse.com/game/TDBOY-000001-01/ greenhouse] and [http://2dboy.com/games.php the developer's own site]. For European customers it is cheaper from the two latter sources. This game is also available on the Wii.
 * The Maw - available on [http://store.steampowered.com/app/26000/ Steam] and [http://www.playgreenhouse.com/game/TWSPX-000001-01/ greenhouse]. Again, cheaper from greenhouse if you live in Europe. This game is also available on the Xbox 360.
 * Crayon Physics Deluxe - available DRM-free from [http://www.crayonphysics.com/ the developer's own site], and also available for iPhone.
